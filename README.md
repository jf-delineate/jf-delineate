I love Software, Cloud, DevSecOps & Quality Engineering.  Despite leading large engineering teams I continue to remain hands on and intend to move back from Engineering leadership/management to being an [IC](https://www.betterup.com/blog/individual-contributor) before retirement!

I host the majority of my repos on the GitHub organisation [delineateio](https://github.com/delineateio) rather than a a personal account at [jf-delineate](https://github.com/jf-delineate).  This is so that I can learn more about GitHub organisaional features. I do not use GitHub at work so the my contributions are within my personal time.
